# Audit Dashboard Navigation Fix

This document explains how to fix the issue where other sections don't work after clicking on the audit dashboard section.

## Issue Description

The audit dashboard section has multiple issues that cause problems with navigation:

1. It contains script code that doesn't properly clean up event listeners and timers when navigating away
2. It has script code with syntax issues that can break JavaScript execution
3. It uses `location.reload()` in the `updateAuditEvents` function which disrupts the single-page application flow
4. There are duplicate function declarations and event listeners that cause conflicts

## Fix Overview

The following fixes have been implemented:

1. **Audit Dashboard Component (`audit-dashboard.html`)**
   - Fixed duplicate and improperly structured script tags
   - Added proper event listener tracking and cleanup
   - Removed the page reload call that was breaking navigation
   - Wrapped all code in an IIFE to prevent global scope pollution

2. **Resource Tracker (`js/resource-tracker.js`)**
   - Created a utility to track and clean up resources like event listeners and timers
   - This prevents memory leaks and ensures sections clean up properly when navigating away

3. **Section Navigation Fix (`js/section-navigation-fix.js`)**
   - Enhanced the app's section navigation to handle cleanup when switching between sections
   - Added special handling for the audit dashboard section

4. **Module Loader Fix (`js/module-loader-fix.js`)**
   - Enhanced the module loader to properly handle cleaning up sections when navigating away
   - Added special handling for the audit dashboard
   
5. **App Fixer (`js/app-fixer.js`)**
   - Enhances the app.js functionality without modifying the original file
   - Adds proper section transition events and cleanup
   - Fixes timer and event tracking
   
6. **Section Loader Fix (`js/section-loader-fix.js`)**
   - Improves the section content loading mechanism
   - Adds better error handling and loading indicators
   - Ensures proper initialization and cleanup of loaded sections

## Installation Instructions

There are two ways to implement these fixes:

### Method 1: Manual File Updates

1. Replace the `audit-dashboard.html` file with the fixed version
2. Copy the new files to the appropriate directories:
   - `js/resource-tracker.js`
   - `js/section-navigation-fix.js`
   - `js/module-loader-fix.js`
3. Update the `royalties.html` file to include these new scripts

### Method 2: Dynamic Script Injection (Easier)

1. Load the web app as usual
2. Open your browser's developer console (F12)
3. Copy the contents of `update-scripts-improved.js` and paste it into the console
4. Press Enter to execute
5. Check the console for confirmation that the scripts were loaded

This second method is preferred as it doesn't require modifying any existing files and will dynamically inject the fix scripts. You'll see progress indicators in the console as each script is loaded.

## Testing

After implementing the fix, you should:

1. Navigate to the audit dashboard
2. Interact with various elements (filters, buttons, etc.)
3. Try to navigate to other sections
4. Confirm that all sections load and function as expected

## Technical Details

The main issues fixed were:

1. **Event Listener Cleanup**: The audit dashboard was creating event listeners but not cleaning them up when navigating away
2. **Script Structure Issues**: There were syntax errors and improperly closed script tags
3. **Page Reload**: The dashboard was calling `location.reload()` which broke the SPA navigation
4. **Global Scope Pollution**: Many functions were being added to the global scope without proper namespacing

The fix introduces a robust resource tracking system that ensures all resources are properly cleaned up when navigating between sections.
