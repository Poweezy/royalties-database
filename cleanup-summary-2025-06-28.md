# Cleanup Summary - 2025-06-28

## Audit Dashboard Removal

As part of the ongoing cleanup effort, all audit dashboard functionality has been completely removed from the application:

### Code Removed
- Removed all audit dashboard event handlers and functions from `js/app.js`
- Removed audit dashboard navigation link from sidebar in `app.js`
- Updated diagnostics script to remove audit dashboard checks in `js/diagnostics.js`

### Previously Moved Files
The following files were already moved to the `removed-audit-dashboard/` folder:
- `components/audit-dashboard.html`
- `js/audit-dashboard.js`
- `js/audit-dashboard-fix.js`
- `js/controllers/auditDashboardController.js`
- `js/components/auditLogs.js`
- `html/components/audit-dashboard.html`
- `html/components/audit-logs.html`
- `dashboard/audit.html`
- `css/audit-dashboard.css`
- `audit-dashboard-fix-README.md`

### Technical Details
- Preserved basic audit logging functionality to maintain action history
- Kept the `DataManager.auditLog`, `getAuditLog()`, and `addAuditEntry()` methods to support system logging
- Updated all relevant diagnostics to not check for audit dashboard components
- Ensured no remaining references to audit dashboard UI elements

## Next Steps
- Consider removing `DataManager.auditLog` if audit logging is not required for other features
- Review dashboard functionality to ensure no dependencies on removed audit components
- Test all remaining navigation and functionality thoroughly
