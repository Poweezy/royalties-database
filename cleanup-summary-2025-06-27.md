# Cleanup Summary - 2025-06-27

## Changes Made

### Files Removed
- `app.js.backup` (root directory)
- `chart-manager.js` (root directory) 
- `chart-manager-v2.js` (root directory)
- `js/utils/stateManager.js` (empty file)
- `js/utils/validation.js` (empty file)

### Files Added
- `js/utils.js` (consolidated utility functions)

### Files Updated
- `app.js` (updated to use Utils module)
- `CLEANUP-README.md` (added new changes)
- `CLEAN-UP-GUIDE.md` (marked completed items)

## Additional Notes

The utility functions were consolidated from the redundant files into a single `js/utils.js` file. These utilities include:

- `Utils.suppressNonCriticalErrors()` - Reduces console noise
- `Utils.formatCurrency()` - Formats numbers as currency
- `Utils.formatDate()` - Formats dates consistently
- `Utils.validateEmail()` - Validates email addresses
- `Utils.debounce()` - Creates debounced functions
- `Utils.throttle()` - Creates throttled functions
- And many more helper functions

App.js was updated to use the new Utils module with a fallback if not available.

The cleanup guides have been updated to reflect the changes made and indicate which files remain to be addressed.
