# Redundant Files List

The following files are redundant and can be safely deleted from the codebase:

## Backup Files
These files are older backups of app.js and aren't needed:
- redundant-files/app.js.backup
- redundant-files/app.js.bak
- redundant-files/app.js.fixed

## Old Module Files
These modules have been consolidated into the main application files:
- redundant-files/js/dashboard.js
- redundant-files/js/modules/dashboard.js
- redundant-files/js/modules/navigation.js
- redundant-files/js/modules/NavigationManager.js
- redundant-files/js/ui/dashboardManager.js
- redundant-files/js/ui/navigationManager.js 
- redundant-files/js/ui/sectionManagers.js

## Why These Files Are Redundant

1. **app.js backup files**
   - These are older versions of app.js that are no longer needed
   - The current app.js contains all the necessary functionality

2. **Redundant module files**
   - The functionality from these files has been consolidated into the main application
   - This improves performance by reducing HTTP requests and simplifies maintenance
   - Navigation is now handled by app.js directly

## What to Keep

Make sure to keep:
- app.js
- js/audit-dashboard-fix.js
- js/controllers/auditDashboardController.js
- js/section-navigation-fix.js
- fix.js
- NAVIGATION-FIX-README.md

All other redundant files can be safely removed.
