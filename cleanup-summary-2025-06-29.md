# Cleanup Summary - 2025-06-29

This document summarizes the cleanup activities performed on June 29, 2025, specifically focusing on resolving chart display issues after removing the audit dashboard functionality.

## Chart Display Issue Fixed

### Problem
After removing the audit dashboard functionality, charts were not displaying in the main dashboard. This was due to conflicts between chart initialization methods in the app.js and components/dashboard.html files.

### Resolution
1. Created diagnostic and fix scripts to identify and address chart display issues:
   - `js/chart-diagnostic.js`: Diagnoses chart loading issues
   - `js/chart-fix.js`: Provides robust chart initialization

2. The fix ensures charts are initialized in these scenarios:
   - When the dashboard section is first loaded
   - When switching to the dashboard section
   - After chart manager is available

3. Added a fallback mechanism that tries multiple approaches:
   - Uses the dashboard component's initialization function if available
   - Falls back to the app class method if available
   - Creates charts manually if neither initialization function works

### Technical Implementation
- Added event listeners to detect when dashboard section becomes visible
- Modified the section showing mechanism to trigger chart initialization
- Created proper error handling to diagnose chart loading issues
- Implemented chart canvas detection and fallback chart creation

## Other Improvements
- Added comprehensive documentation in `chart-fix-documentation.md`
- Ensured Chart.js is properly loaded before any chart initialization
- Added diagnostic logs for easier troubleshooting

## Files Modified
- `royalties.html`: Added diagnostic and fix scripts
- `js/chart-diagnostic.js`: New file for chart diagnostics
- `js/chart-fix.js`: New file with chart initialization fix
- `chart-fix-documentation.md`: Documentation of the issue and fix

## Verification Steps
1. Load the royalties.html page
2. Navigate to the dashboard section
3. Verify that all charts (revenue trends, entity distribution, etc.) display properly
4. Test switching between sections and returning to dashboard
5. Open browser console to confirm no chart-related errors

## Next Steps
- Consider standardizing chart initialization approach
- Improve chart data loading from actual data sources
- Review other components for similar initialization issues
