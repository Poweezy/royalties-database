# Navigation Fix for Royalties Database

This README explains how to fix the issue where other sections don't load after visiting the audit dashboard section.

## Quick Fix

You can quickly fix this issue without modifying any files by:

1. Open the Royalties Database application in your browser
2. Press F12 to open the Developer Console
3. Copy the entire contents of the `fix.js` file
4. Paste it into the console and press Enter
5. You should see a success message in the console

After applying this fix, you'll be able to navigate freely between all sections, including after visiting the audit dashboard.

## Permanent Fix

To permanently fix this issue:

1. In the `royalties.html` file, add the following script tag just before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<script src="fix.js"></script>
```

2. This will ensure the fix is automatically applied every time the application loads.

## Technical Details

The issue is caused by the `updateAuditEvents` function in `audit-dashboard.html` calling `location.reload()` when filters are applied. This reloads the entire application, which breaks the navigation state.

The fix:
1. Overrides the problematic `updateAuditEvents` function with a version that doesn't use `location.reload()`
2. Adds proper cleanup when leaving the audit dashboard section
3. Tracks and cleans up timers to prevent memory leaks

## For Developers

If you're updating the application, please note:
1. Never use `location.reload()` in section-specific code
2. Always clean up resources (event listeners, timers) when navigating away from a section
3. Use the provided event system (`sectionChange` events) to manage section lifecycle
