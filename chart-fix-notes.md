# Chart Fix Implementation

## Issue Fixed
Fixed chart initialization errors in the dashboard, particularly the missing `createProductionChart` method and canvas ID inconsistencies.

## Solution
1. Created a unified chart fix script (`js/chart-unified-fix.js`) that:
   - Ensures all required chart methods exist on `window.chartManager`
   - Handles canvas ID aliasing between `production-by-entity-chart` and `revenue-by-entity-chart`
   - Properly initializes charts when the dashboard becomes visible

2. Added proper implementations of:
   - `createProductionChart` - Works with both canvas IDs
   - `createEntityChart` - Aliases to production chart with data conversion
   - Better error handling for all chart creation methods

3. Added diagnostic capabilities to help troubleshoot any remaining issues

## Implementation Details
The fix addresses three core issues:
1. Missing chart methods in `window.chartManager`
2. Inconsistent canvas IDs in the HTML
3. Charts not initializing when dashboard is displayed

The unified fix systematically resolves all three issues with a single, comprehensive approach.

## Files Modified
- Added: `js/chart-unified-fix.js`
- Modified: `royalties.html` to include the new scripts

## Testing
The fix has been tested and confirmed to work with the existing dashboard.
