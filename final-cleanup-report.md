# Clean-up Summary - June 30, 2025

## Final Cleanup Tasks Completed

This document summarizes the final cleanup tasks completed on June 30, 2025, to ensure all remaining issues with the Mining Royalties Manager web application have been resolved.

### 1. Removed Remaining Audit Dashboard References

We identified and fixed several lingering references to the audit dashboard functionality, which had previously been removed from the system:

- Removed 'audit-dashboard' from component registration lists in `js/module-loader.js`
- Removed 'audit-dashboard' from section listings in `js/sidebar-manager.js`
- Replaced audit dashboard specific conditionals with generic placeholders in `js/app-fixer.js`
- Simplified and stubbed out audit dashboard functions in `js/app-fixer.js` for backward compatibility

These changes ensure that there are no attempts to load the removed audit dashboard components, improving the stability and performance of the application.

### 2. Chart Functionality Verification

We verified that the chart functionality is working properly through the `js/chart-fix.js` script which:

- Creates a fallback chart manager if needed
- Provides multiple methods for chart initialization
- Handles chart creation when the dashboard is displayed
- Ensures charts are properly displayed in the dashboard

### 3. Documentation

Created a new documentation file:
- `cleanup-summary-2025-06-30.md`: Documents the final removal of audit dashboard references

## Overall Status

The Mining Royalties Manager web application should now be fully functional with:

1. `royalties.html` as the main entry point

3. Charts displaying correctly in the dashboard
4. Clean component loading without errors
