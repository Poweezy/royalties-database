## How to Use the Application

1. Open `royalties.html` in your web browser
2. If you see security warnings about running scripts, you may need to serve the application through a web server:
   - Using Python: `python -m http.server`
   - Using Node.js: `npx http-server`
   - Using VS Code Live Server extension

3. Login credentials:
   - Username: `admin`, Password: `admin123`

## Troubleshooting

If the application doesn't load properly:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Make sure all files are in the correct locations according to the service worker file (`sw.js`)
3. Try serving the application through a web server instead of opening the file directly
4. Clear browser cache if you've previously accessed a different version

## Technical Details

The application now has:
- Robust error handling for component loading
- Fallback content for file:// protocol
